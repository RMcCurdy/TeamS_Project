# TeamS_Project
This is the CPSC 481 project for Team S.  

The WaitLess project idea revolves around improving the virtual academic advising experience for students by refining a virtual line up system. The current solution, QLess, has problems that will be addressed with our idea while also adding improvements to make lining up virtually easy and convenient. We expect our system to be used as a mobile application where students can virtually line up for drop-in advising at their university/school. The system will also be used by academic advisors who will conduct and manage their queues by assisting the first student in the queue and updating the status of the queue. Advisors will also provide an information page for students to read before they decide to join the queue. For the purpose of this project, we expect this system will be used under the context of an academic environment between student and advisor. We don't expect the student to use this system daily as advising meetings are infrequent.

Following the completetion of stage 5, a demo video of our high fidelity prototype can be seen by clicking on the image below:
