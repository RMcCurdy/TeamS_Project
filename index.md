We are developing a mobile application that helps making it easier to join lines, called WaitLess.
The WaitLess project idea revolves around improving the virtual academic advising experience for students by refining a virtual line up system. The current solution, QLess, has problems that will be addressed with our idea while also adding improvements to make lining up virtually easy and convenient.  We expect our system to be used as a mobile application where students can virtually line up for drop-in advising at their university/school.  This system will be used by the aforementioned students and academic advisors that will be conducting these line ups.  The context at which we expect this system will be used under is in an academic environment between student and advisor.  We don't expect the student to use this system daily, but we expect the advisors to use this system daily to provide guidance to students.
